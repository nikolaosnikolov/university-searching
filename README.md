# university-searching
## What is the name of this project?
This project is called University Searching.
## What does this project do?
This project is taking data live from a public API. These data are related to universities, and general details for each university. The excact source from which the data are taken can be found inside my codes. This project is using React and Bootstrap. I am fetching data live from a source as I mentioned before, using Axios. Axios is similar to fetch() as regards the final result, but I prefer to use Axios because it is a bit easiest and there are many advantages of using it. The basement of that project was copied by me from Dr. Williams videos on the course MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding with MERN. I was coding for about 4 hours, making a lot of debugging, but the final result seems good.
## How to run this website?
Take this file structure to your editor (such as Visual Studio code), with the files of code. Run the index.html file (I am using Live Server).
